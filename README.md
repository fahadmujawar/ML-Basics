- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering insights using visualizations and descriptive statistics.
- **Supervised Learning Models**: Comparing performance of algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and SVM.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- Full machine learning workflow using **Scikit-learn**.
- Extensive **Feature Engineering** and preprocessing techniques.
- **Cross-Validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** for performance optimization.
- **Data Visualization** with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/YourRepoName.git
    ```
2. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
